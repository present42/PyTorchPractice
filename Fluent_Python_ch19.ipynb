If you start a coroutine using the `await` keyword, it's easy to get a value returned by it, it can be safely cancelled and you have a clear stie to catch exception.

A process can create more threads to operate concurrently by calling operating system APIs. Threads within a process share the same memory space, which holds live Python objects. This allows easy data sharing between threads, but can also lead to corrupted data when more than one thread updates the same obj concurrently.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Each instance of Python interpreter is a process. You can start additional Python processes using `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` library. Python's `subprocess` lib is designed to launch processes to run external programs, regardless of the languages used to write them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The Python interpreter uses a single thread to run the user's program and the memory garbage collector. You can start additional Python threads using the `threading` or `concurrent.futures` lib.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Access to object ref counts and other internal interpreter state is controlled by a lock, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Only one python thread can hold the GIL at any time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. To prevent a Python thread from holding the GIL indefinitely, Python bytecode interpreter pauses the current Python thread every 5ms by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When we write Python code, we have no control over the GIL. but a built-in fcn or an extension written in C (or any lang that interfaces at the Python/C api level) can release the GIL while running time-consuming tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Every Python standard lib fcn that makes a `syscall` releases the GIL. This includes all fcns that perform disk I/O, network I/O, and `time.sleep()`. Many CPU intensive fcns in the NumPy/SciPy libraries also release the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Extensions that integrate at the Python/C API level can also launch other non-Python threads that are not affected by the GIL. Such GIL-free threads generally cannot change Python objs, but they can read from and write to the memory underlying objects that support the \"buffer protocol\" such as `bytearray`, `array.array` and Numpy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The effect of the GIL on network programming with Python threads is relatively small, because I/O fcn release the GIL, and r/w to the network always implies high latency. Consequently, each individual thread spends a lot of time waiting anyway, so their execution can be interleaved w/o major impact on the overall throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Contention over the GIL slows down compute-intensive Python threads. Sequential, single-threaded code is simpler and faster for such tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. To run CPU-intensive Python code on multiple cores, you must use multiple Python processes."
